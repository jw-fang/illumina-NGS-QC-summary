# Illumina QC Summary Automation
The python script were created to automate the extraction of QC parameters from Illumina Miseq and Nextseq platforms. 2 scripts are available in this project to facilitate this purpose.

# export.py
This script will be useful if your sequencing runs were stored in servers. As the run-time of the actual script increases when accessing files over the server, the script will:
1) Locate folders with Illumina folder convention
2) Extract the necessary files
3) Export locally to selected location

## How to run
1) Execute the script export.py
2) Dialogue pop-up asks you to choose the approximate location of the sequencing runs
3)
